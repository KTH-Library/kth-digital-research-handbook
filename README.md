# KTH Digital Research Handbook

This repository contains the content for the KTH Digital Research Handbook website.

The handbook is maintained in two languages:

- English: `docs/en/`
- Swedish: `docs/sv/`

## Before you start

- If you only want to edit text, you can do everything directly in GitHub (no local setup needed).
- If you want to preview changes on your computer, follow the local setup section below.

## Easiest way to contribute (no local setup)

1. Open this repository on GitHub.
2. Go to the page you want to change in `docs/en/` or `docs/sv/`.
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit this file).
4. Make your changes.
5. Scroll down and choose "Create a new branch".
6. Click "Propose changes".
7. Open a pull request.

## Where files are

- `docs/`: all handbook pages and images.
- `docs/en/`: English pages.
- `docs/sv/`: Swedish pages.
- `mkdocs.yml`: website menu/navigation.
- `site/`: generated website files. Do not edit this folder manually.

## Adding Documentation Files

### Documentation

- Create a new Markdown file: Add your new documentation file in the `docs/` directory with an appropriate name.
- Update `mkdocs.yml`: Ensure that the new file is included in the nav section of the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file for both `en` and `sv`.

#### Example

If you want to add a new document called usage:

Create `docs/en/usage.md` for the English version.
Create `docs/sv/usage.md` for the Swedish version.
Update `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  # add the new document here
  - Usage: usage.md
# ...
# and for the Swedish version:
plugins:
  - i18n:
    - locale: sv
      name: Svenska
      build: true
      nav:
        - Hem: index.md
        # add the new document here
        - Användning: usage.md
```
