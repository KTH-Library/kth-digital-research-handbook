# What is the handbook intended for and for whom?

This handbook is intended as a guide for researchers and PhD students to assist when questions arise in your research when using some elements of "digital" in your research practice. The goal with the handbook is that it should be easier to find and access knowledge on good research practice, methods, data and digital tools & resources that is of relevance for you as a researcher. There are a several frameworks, policies and international guidelines for good research practice and we link to some of them, but if something relevant is missing - let us know! 
The KTH handbook also provides links to support & services at KTH as well so you as a KTH affiliated researcher know what local support that you can ask for help if you are stuck.
