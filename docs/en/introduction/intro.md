# Introduction - What is good research practice?
Research practice differs between different fields and  domains -so rather than talking about one good research practice, a variety of many practices be viewed as good research practice.  We hope that some people with time will be willing to share suggestions on how a good research practice could look like as a starting point for discussion or inspiration. 
For a start, we can point to some existing general codes of research conduct that exists on Swedish national level:  https://www.vr.se/analys/rapporter/vara-rapporter/2024-10-02-god-forskningssed-2024.html and on European level: https://allea.org/code-of-conduct/
